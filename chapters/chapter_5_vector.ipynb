      "The *OGR* library is a companion library to *GDAL* that handles vector data capabilities, including information queryies, file conversions, rasterization of polygon features, polygonization of raster features, and much more. It handles popular formats including the *ESRI Shapefile*, *Keyhole Markup Language*, *PostGIS*, and *SpatiaLite*. For more information on how *OGR* came about and how it relates to *GDAL*, see here: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FAQGeneral#WhatisthisOGRstuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors of *GDAL*/*OGR* provide a tutorial for the *OGR* library [here](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_apitut.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "> Note: As of 08/12/2014, the API used in this tutorial seems to be ahead of the current 1.11.0 release. Specifically, they demonstrate how to open a vector file using `gdal.OpenEx`, which is a change designed to unify the *GDAL* and *OGR* sections of the library.\n",
      "    \n",
      "> A clone of the *GDAL 1.9* API tutorial can be found [here](http://www.compsci.wm.edu/SciClone/documentation/software/geo/gdal-1.9.0/html/ogr/ogr_apitut.html)\n",
