=================

Tutorial of basic remote sensing and GIS methodologies using open source software (GDAL in Python)

## Access
#### IPython Notebook chapters
You can view these IPython notebooks as HTML pages by viewing them locally by opening the outputs in the `build` folder, or by accessing the IPython notebooks via a web viewer at [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ceholden/open-geo-tutorial/tree/master/chapters/).

#### Python scripts
Python scripts containing each chapter's raw Python code are found in the `src` folder.


## Requirements

Python package requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.

You will need to have GDAL installed for Python to build the drivers against. You may have the Python bindings already built as part of GDAL's installation process.
